# Extend ChatGPT with Community Actions

Welcome to our project where we empower ChatGPT with custom community actions! This is an open invitation for developers like you to contribute and enrich ChatGPT's capabilities. Join us in building an extensive, dynamic, and diverse set of actions that ChatGPT can perform.

## About This Project

We've developed a way to seamlessly integrate custom actions into ChatGPT using FastAPI. This allows ChatGPT to perform a wide range of functions, from fetching stock data to generating graphs, and even interacting with external APIs. Our goal is to expand ChatGPT's utility and make it a more versatile tool for users across various domains.

## API key access 

We are in a private.beta, if you would like to get API key for testing please sign up to a waitlist: https://forms.gle/V18giB3upYiG7ARq8

## How to Run an action from "Community Actions"

1. Decide what actions you plan to use in your GPT.
2. Go to [GPT Editor](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor) -> Configure -> Scroll to the very bottom -> Add action -> Click `Import from URL`
3. Paste `https://actions.tryfabrika.com/combine?actions=<ACTIONS>`, where `<ACTIONS>` is a list of action separated with `,`:
   - Examples:
     - Single action: `https://actions.tryfabrika.com/combine?actions=yfinance`
     - Multiple actions: `https://actions.tryfabrika.com/combine?actions=template,yfinance`
4. Go to Authentification -> Click on `Edit` -> Select `API Key` -> Insert your API key -> Select `Bearer` at `Auth Type`

Congrats! Your action is ready to be used by ChatGPT!
